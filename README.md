# Surfs_Up

## Project Overview

To build a surf and shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii, I needed to secure investors. 
One investor, W. Avy said he would not invest until I showed him data proving that Oahu is the perfect location for a shake shack.

### Purpose

To reassure W. Avy, I analyzed weather data from Oahu, specifically looking at temperature trends for June and December, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is a sustainable business year-round.

## Resources

- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.7.7, Matplotlib 3.2.2, JupyterLab 2.1.5, Pandas 1.0.5, matplotlib 3.2.2, SQLAlchemy 1.3, NumPy 1.19
  
## Results

My analysis shows three key differences in weather between June and December:
1. First major difference
2. s
3. sdkj
4. 
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December.

## Summary
There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
The results of my study show data that backs up Oahu as the perfect place to surf (even in December) and therefore is the perfect location to open up a surf and ice cream show.
